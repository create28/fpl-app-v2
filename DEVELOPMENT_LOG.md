# FPL Application Development Log

## Session Date: January 2025
**Session Goal**: Debug and fix "The Wall" award calculation and player data persistence issues

---

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### ✅ Issue 1: Database Schema Migration Problem
**Problem**: `player_performance` table was being dropped and recreated every time `DatabaseManager` was instantiated, causing data loss.

**Root Cause**: The `init_database()` method in `database_manager.py` was calling migration logic on every constructor call, not just when needed.

**Solution**: Modified `init_database()` method to check if the table already exists before running migration:
```python
# Check if player_performance table exists with correct schema
c.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='player_performance'")
if c.fetchone():
    print("Player performance table exists with correct schema")
    return
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Data Key Mismatch in Player Performance Storage
**Problem**: Player data was not being saved because of mismatched dictionary keys between `web_server.py` and `database_manager.py`.

**Root Cause**: 
- `web_server.py` was passing `id` and `name` keys
- `database_manager.py` expected `player_id` and `player_name` keys

**Solution**: Updated `web_server.py` to use consistent key names:
```python
player_data = {
    'player_id': pick['element'],
    'player_name': player_info['name'],
    # ... other fields
}
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

### ✅ Issue 3: Missing FPL API Endpoint for Player Performance
**Problem**: The application was only fetching team picks (which don't include individual player points) instead of actual player performance data.

**Root Cause**: Missing `get_player_performance()` method in `fpl_api.py` to fetch individual player gameweek performance.

**Solution**: Added new API endpoint:
```python
def get_player_performance(self, player_id, gameweek):
    """Get player performance data for a specific gameweek."""
    return self.fetch_data(f"element-summary/{player_id}/")
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

### ✅ Issue 4: Database Initialization Logic
**Problem**: Database tables were being recreated unnecessarily, causing data loss.

**Root Cause**: `init_database()` was running on every `DatabaseManager` instantiation.

**Solution**: Added existence checks before table creation/migration.

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Current Persistent Issues

### ❌ Issue 1: Player Performance Data Still Not Being Saved with Points
**Problem**: Even after implementing the correct API endpoint and fixing data key mismatches, player performance data is still being saved with 0 points.

**Current Status**: Player data is being fetched and saved (255 records for gameweek 2), but all `gw_points` values are 0.

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- Database query shows 0 points for all players
SELECT player_name, gw_points FROM player_performance WHERE gameweek = 2 LIMIT 5;
-- Result: All players show 0 points
```

**Debug Attempts Made**:
1. ✅ Verified FPL API returns correct data (Estève got 6 points in gameweek 2)
2. ✅ Confirmed API response structure has `history` field with `round` and `total_points`
3. ✅ Added debug logging to trace data flow
4. ❌ Debug logging not appearing due to loop variable issues

**Suspected Root Cause**: The individual player performance API calls in `fetch_player_data_for_gameweek()` are either:
- Failing silently
- Returning unexpected data structure
- Having logic errors in point extraction

**Next Steps Required**:
1. Fix debug logging to actually appear
2. Trace the exact data flow from API response to database storage
3. Verify the `get_player_performance()` method is being called correctly
4. Check if there are rate limiting or API error issues

---

### ❌ Issue 2: "The Wall" Award Still Not Displaying
**Problem**: Despite having player performance data in the database, "The Wall" award is not being calculated or displayed.

**Current Status**: Award calculation is being skipped because `_check_player_data_availability()` returns `False`.

**Evidence**:
```python
# Awards calculator shows:
"No player performance data available for gameweek 2, skipping detailed awards"
```

**Root Cause**: The `_check_player_data_availability()` method is not finding the player data, even though it exists in the database.

**Next Steps Required**:
1. Debug why `_check_player_data_availability()` is returning `False`
2. Verify the database query logic in the awards calculator
3. Ensure the awards calculation can access the saved player data

---

## Technical Architecture Status

### ✅ Working Components
1. **FPL API Integration**: Successfully fetching league standings, team picks, and bootstrap data
2. **Database Schema**: Correct tables created with proper structure
3. **Player Data Fetching**: Successfully processing 17 teams with 15 players each
4. **Data Storage**: Player records are being saved to database (255 records for gameweek 2)
5. **Basic Awards**: League rankings and basic awards are working correctly

### ❌ Non-Working Components
1. **Player Performance Points**: All players showing 0 points instead of actual FPL scores
2. **Detailed Awards**: "The Wall", "Benchwarmer", "Captain Fantastic" not being calculated
3. **Debug Logging**: Debug output not appearing to trace data flow issues

---

## Code Changes Made This Session

### 1. `database_manager.py`
- Fixed `init_database()` to prevent unnecessary table recreation
- Added existence checks before migration logic

### 2. `fpl_api.py`
- Added `get_player_performance()` method for individual player data

### 3. `web_server.py`
- Updated `fetch_player_data_for_gameweek()` to fetch actual player performance
- Fixed data key names to match database expectations
- Added debug logging (currently not working due to loop variable issues)

---

## Immediate Next Actions Required

### Priority 1: Fix Debug Logging
- Resolve the loop variable issue preventing debug output
- Add comprehensive logging to trace data flow from API to database

### Priority 2: Debug Player Performance API Calls
- Verify `get_player_performance()` method is working correctly
- Check for silent API failures or unexpected response structures

### Priority 3: Fix Point Extraction Logic
- Ensure gameweek matching logic works correctly
- Verify the `round` field in API response matches expected gameweek values

### Priority 4: Test Award Calculation
- Once player points are correctly saved, verify "The Wall" award calculation works

---

## Session Summary

**Progress Made**: 
- ✅ Fixed database migration issues
- ✅ Resolved data key mismatches  
- ✅ Added missing FPL API endpoint
- ✅ Successfully fetching and storing player data structure

**Remaining Issues**:
- ❌ Player performance points still showing as 0
- ❌ Detailed awards not being calculated
- ❌ Debug logging not working to trace remaining issues

**Overall Status**: **75% Complete** - Core infrastructure working, but critical data extraction logic needs debugging.

## Notes for Future Sessions

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Current implementation uses 2-second delays between teams
2. **Data Volume**: Processing 17 teams × 15 players = 255 API calls per gameweek
3. **Database Integrity**: Migration logic now prevents data loss on restarts
4. **Debug Strategy**: Need to implement working debug logging to trace data flow issues
